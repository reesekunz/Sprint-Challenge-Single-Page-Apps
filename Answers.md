1. Explain benefit(s) using `client-side routing`?

- A benefit of client-side routing is that the browser doesnâ€™t need to completely refresh every time there is a request, only the state of the elements inside the application will change. Thsi is because the route is handled by the JavaScript within a client app that will manage the data with its own memory.


2. What does AJAX stand for?

- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML 


3. What are `controlled components` in React?

- Controlled components are components where the input is controlled through the parent, stateful components. Through controlled components, the app itself is controlling the inputs through state rather than uncontrolled inputs where DOM elements are controling the inputs (not encouraged). 


4. Name three tools/libraries for making AJAX requests.

- Axios, Fetch API, jQuery $.ajax
